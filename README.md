# University_Android

It is built on Android Studio using Java.

This is an android application. It tries to simulate the functionality of a school management system.

It allows a user to sign up as a student or lecturer.
The student can:
  <ul>
    <li>Select and Register courses upto a maximum of five</li>
    <li>View registered courses and the status of the grade of the course</li>
  </ul>

A lecturer on the other hand can:
  <ul>
    <li>Be assigned a course by the Admin</li>
    <li>View the course he/she has been assigned</li>
    <li>View the students registered in the course</li>
    <li>Add marks for the students in the course</li>
  </ul>

The all powerful admin can:
  <ul>
    <li>Create new users either student or lecturer</li>
    <li>Create new course and assign a lecturer to the course</li>
    <li>View all courses that are being taught in the school</li>
    <li>View all students registered in a certain course</li>
    <li>Edit marks for students registered in the course</li>
    <li>Generate reports of students who have passed, failed or have pending results</li>
  </ul>
